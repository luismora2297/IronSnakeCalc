# IronSnakeCalc
A numerical methods calculator fully written in Python and some modules for it.

## Details :goberserk:

This application has two ways to be installed, as a **GUI** program, or as a **Web Application**.

At the same time, the development has been divided in two major folders, which, depends on how the user prefer to install, initially, most of the web browsers are not tested, so if you don use any of the browsers that will be listed down, the Web Application may not work well.

If the user install the program as a GUI, then, it has to be stablished that mainly, the application is only working on Linux Distros, if you use Mac OS, BSD, Windows or any other Operative System, at the time, it has not support for them, just only linux, if you wish to contribute to port the program to other OS's, feel free to fork the repo or contribute to the code, but first contact me personally to add the permissions to allow modification in the repo, and to put your name in the credits, *"the more heads and hands that contribute to the code, the more interesting and powerfull it gets"*.

This application is developed in Python 3.X.X, i haven't try on Python 2.X.X so, maybe most part of the application may not work, please, leave behind older versions of python and work with Python 3!
